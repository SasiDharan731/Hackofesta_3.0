                        Late blight, also called potato blight, disease of
                        potato and tomato plants that is caused by the water
                        mold Phytophthora infestans. The disease occurs in humid
                        regions with temperatures ranging between 4 and 29 °C
                        (40 and 80 °F). Hot dry weather checks its spread.
                        Potato or tomato plants that are infected may rot within
                        two weeks. The Great Famine in Ireland in the mid-19th
                        century was caused by late blight of the potato plant.
                        Late blight destroyed more than half of the tomato crop
                        in the eastern United States in 1946, leading to the
                        establishment of a blight-forecasting service in 1947. A
                        number of such forecasting services are maintained at
                        universities and governmental organizations across the
                        world.

                        If symptoms are observed, treat plants with one of the
                        following fungicides: Apply a copper based fungicide (2
                        oz/ gallon of water) every 7 days or less, following
                        heavy rain or when the amount of disease is increasing
                        rapidly. If possible, time applications so that at least
                        12 hours of dry weather follows application. Used as a
                        foliar spray, Organocide® Plant Doctor will work its way
                        through the entire plant to prevent fungal problems from
                        occurring and attack existing many problems. Mix 2 tsp/
                        gallon of water and spray at transplant or when direct
                        seeded crops are at 2-4 true leaf, then at 1-2 week
                        intervals as required to control disease. Safely treat
